System Overview 
Implementation Details
Firebase Authentication
Google login was implemented using Firebase Authentication. This provides seamless integration with Google accounts and manages session persistence across page refreshes.
Firestore Database
User data (e.g., name, bio, institution, and interests) is stored in Firestore under a "users" collection. Data is updated using Firebase's setDoc method, ensuring that old information is replaced with new submissions.
Frontend Components
Profile Page
Displays user information retrieved from Firestore.
Currently supports basic profile viewing but requires further functionality for comprehensive user searches.
Edit Profile Page
Contains individual forms for updating specific profile fields (e.g., bio or institution).
Automatically updates Firestore with submitted changes.
Search Page
Allows users to search for profiles. While functional, it currently lacks the ability to search by user names stored only in Firebase Auth.

Issues, Bugs, and Improvements 
Identified Issue: Search Functionality
Problem:
Currently, users cannot search profiles by name because the name field from Google Authentication is not stored in the Firestore database.
Solution:
Implement a system to store the name retrieved from Google Authentication in Firestore during the initial login.
Modify the search functionality to query the name field in the database instead of relying solely on the Firebase Authentication name.
Justification:
Storing the name in Firestore ensures that it is searchable alongside other user data. This approach integrates seamlessly with the existing system and leverages Firestore's powerful querying capabilities.
